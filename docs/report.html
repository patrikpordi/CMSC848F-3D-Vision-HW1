Re-creating the Dolly Zoom
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The [Dolly Zoom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolly_zoom) is a famous camera effect,
first used in the Alfred Hitchcock film
[Vertigo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G7YJkBcRWB8).
The core idea is to change the focal length of the camera while moving the camera in a
way such that the subject is the same size in the frame, producing a rather unsettling
effect.

My implementation of the Dolly Zoom effect can be seen below.

Practicing with Meshes 
===============================================================================

Constructing a Tetrahedron
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In this part, you will practice working with the geometry of 3D meshes.
Construct a [tetrahedron mesh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Types_of_mesh#Tetrahedron) and then render it from multiple viewpoints. 
Your tetrahedron does not need to be a regular
tetrahedron (i.e. not all faces need to be equilateral triangles) as long as it is
obvious from the renderings that the shape is a tetrahedron.

You will need to manually define the vertices and faces of the mesh. Once you have the
vertices and faces, you can define a single-color texture, similarly to the cow in
`render_mesh.py`. Remember that the faces are the vertex indices of the triangle mesh. 

It may help to draw a picture of your tetrahedron and label the vertices and assign 3D
coordinates.

**Question: How many vertices and (triangle) faces your mesh should have?**

**Answer:** My equilateral tetrahedron should have **4 vertices** and **4 faces**.

Constructing a Cube
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Construct a cube mesh and then render it from multiple viewpoints. Remember that we are
still working with triangle meshes, so you will need to use two sets of triangle faces
to represent one face of the cube.


**Question: How many vertices and (triangle) faces your mesh should have?** 

**Answer:** The cube should have **8 vertices** and **12 faces**.

Re-texturing a mesh
===============================================================================

Now let's practice re-texturing a mesh. For this task, we will be retexturing the cow
mesh such that the color smoothly changes from the front of the cow to the back of the
cow.

**Question:** What are the two colors you used to re-texture the cow mesh?

**Answer:** `Color_1`  `Light Green (0.2,0.8,0.2)` and `Color_2` `Blue (0,0,1)` . The gif of the rendered mesh is shown below.

Camera Transformations
===============================================================================
When working with 3D, finding a reasonable camera pose is often the first step to
producing a useful visualization, and an important first step toward debugging.



What are the relative camera transformations that would produce each of the following
output images? You should find a set (R_relative, T_relative) such that the new camera
extrinsics with `R = R_relative @ R_0` and `T = R_relative @ T_0 + T_relative` produces
each of the following images:


**Answer:** 
Camera transformations are handled utilizing 'pytorch3d.renderer.FoVPerspectiveCameras'. The camera's extrinsics are defined using R<sub>relative</sub> and T<sub>relative</sub> with the following formulas:

R<sub>camera</sub> = R<sub>relative</sub> @ R<sub>0</sub>

T<sub>camera</sub> = R<sub>relative</sub> @ T<sub>0</sub> + T<sub>relative</sub>

Where Rotation about x, y, z axis is defined as follows:

<style>
    .matrix-container {
      display: flex;
      flex-direction: row;
      justify-content: space-between;
    }
    
    .matrix {
      border: 1px solid black;
      padding: 10px;
      margin: 10px;
    }
</style>

<div class="matrix-container">
    <div class="matrix">
      \(R_x = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & \cos(\theta) & -\sin(\theta) \\ 0 & \sin(\theta) & \cos(\theta) \end{bmatrix}\)
    </div>
  
    <div class="matrix">
      \(R_y = \begin{bmatrix} \cos(\theta) & 0 & \sin(\theta) \\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\ -\sin(\theta) & 0 & \cos(\theta) \end{bmatrix}\)
    </div>
  
    <div class="matrix">
      \(R_z = \begin{bmatrix} \cos(\theta) & -\sin(\theta) & 0 \\ \sin(\theta) & \cos(\theta) & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix}\)
    </div>
</div>


The relative camera transformations that would produce each of the output images below are the following:

| Image | R_relative | T_relative | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| <div style="background-color: black; padding: 2px;"><img src="rotate_1.png" style="max-width: 100%;"></div> | \(\begin{bmatrix} 0 & -1 & 0 \\ 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix}\) | \(\begin{bmatrix}0 \\ 0 \\ 3\end{bmatrix}\) | The camera is <br> rotated 90 degrees about <br> the z-axis. |
| <div style="background-color: black; padding: 2px;"><img src="rotate_2.png" style="max-width: 100%;"></div> | \(\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 & -1 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 1 & 0 & 0 \end{bmatrix}\) | \(\begin{bmatrix}0 \\ 0 \\ 3\end{bmatrix}\) | The camera is <br> rotated 90 degrees about the <br> y-axis and  translated by <br> 3 units along the z axis. |
| <div style="background-color: black; padding: 2px;"><img src="rotate_3.png" style="max-width: 100%;"></div> | \(\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix}\) | \(\begin{bmatrix}0 \\ 0 \\ 6\end{bmatrix}\) | The camera is <br> translated backwards <br> by 6 units along the <br> z-axis. |
| <div style="background-color: black; padding: 2px;"><img src="rotate_4.png" style="max-width: 100%;"></div> | \(\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix}\) | \(\begin{bmatrix}0.5 \\ -0.5 \\ 3\end{bmatrix}\) | The camera is <br> translated along <br> all 3 axis: <br> By 0.5 units along <br> the x axis; <br> By -0.5 units along <br> the y axis; <br> & <br> By 3 units along <br> the z axis. |

Parametric Functions
===============================================================================
Rendering Point Clouds from RGB-D Images 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In this part, we will practice rendering point clouds constructed from 2 RGB-D images
from the [Common Objects in 3D Dataset](https://github.com/facebookresearch/co3d).


You should use the `unproject_depth_image` function in `utils.py` to convert a depth
image into a point cloud (parameterized as a set of 3D coordinates and corresponding
color values). The `unproject_depth_image` function uses the camera
intrinsics and extrinisics to cast a ray from every pixel in the image into world 
coordinates space. The ray's final distance is the depth value at that pixel, and the
color of each point can be determined from the corresponding image pixel.

Construct 3 different point clouds:
1. The point cloud corresponding to the first image
2. The point cloud corresponding to the second image
3. The point cloud formed by the union of the first 2 point clouds.

Try visualizing each of the point clouds from various camera viewpoints. We suggest
starting with cameras initialized 6 units from the origin with equally spaced azimuth
values.

**Answer:** The pictures and the gifs of the point clouds are the following:

Implicit Surfaces
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**In your writeup, include a 360-degree gif of your torus mesh, and make sure the hole
is visible. In addition, discuss some of the tradeoffs between rendering as a mesh
vs a point cloud. Things to consider might include rendering speed, rendering quality,
ease of use, memory usage, etc.**

**Answer:**

**Part 1:**

</figure>

**Part 2:**
The considerations when choosing between rendering as a mesh versus a point cloud are outlined below:

Creating a point cloud using parametric functions offers several benefits. One advantage is the straightforward generation of point clouds by sampling the functions within a specified range, typically from 0 to 2Ï in our case. The memory usage during the point generation stage follows a linear pattern (O(n)), depending on the number of points to be stored.  However, it's worth noting that this representation is sparse compared to alternatives like meshes. The quality of the point cloud is directly related to the number of sampled points and can be enhanced by increasing the sample count, say from 100 to 1000 points. In other words higher sampling rate results in better quality.

Notably, the mesh is a dense representation compared to the point cloud. Rendering a surface mesh from implicit functions, specifically signed distance functions, involves the construction of a voxel grid. As the term suggests, this approach occupies a cubic amount of memory (O(n^3)). The subsequent step employs the marching cubes algorithm, matching cubes to identify points on the surface where the distance function approaches zero. The combined computational complexity for all these processes is cubic, which is higher than the parametric approach. The quality of the resulting mesh is contingent on the resolution of the voxel grid. Higher resolutions lead to better mesh quality.
